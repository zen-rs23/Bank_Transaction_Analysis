# End-to-End Data Science Project: Bank Transaction Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves the comprehensive analysis of three years of transactional data from a bank, focusing on identifying patterns and trends in customer behavior. The analysis was conducted as part of a university course on Machine Learning Algorithms and Applications, with the aim of providing actionable insights to the bank's data science team.

## Objectives

- **Business Understanding**: Understand the business context and objectives.
- **Data Understanding**: Analyze the structure and nature of the data.
- **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
- **Modeling**: Develop predictive models to extract meaningful insights.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the effectiveness of the models.
- **Deployment**: Provide recommendations based on the findings.

## Skills and Tools Used

- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature engineering
- **Methodology**: CRISP-DM
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebooks, Python
